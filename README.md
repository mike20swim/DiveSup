This is a mobile application I created in 2014 after commencing training at Dive School called DiveSup.

When we started training at dive school, shortly after learning the basics of diving officers were quickly expected to learn how to supervise diving operations. Typically, dive supervisors have years of experience and know the ins and outs of diving and how to track dive time on multiple simultaneous divers with stopwatches. Being new to diving, a lot of the officers, including myself, were struggling to accurately remember when to start and stop tracing times for certain divers while at the same time monitor the safety of each diver.

In order to solve this problem, I created a mobile application that would tell the dive supervisor to press a button on the screen every time new phase started or ended during the diving operation and all times would be tracked on the screen, preventing the dive supervisor from having to remember or write down all the times. Additionally, once the dive was completed, the dive supervisor had the option of creating a local text file with all the times from the dive for the purpose a logging the dive in the future.

DiveSup is able to track not only underwater dives, but chamber treatments as well. It uses the American standard for depth of feet, but it allows users to switch to meters if desired.
